        <p>Tabvoid is javascript code written for weblogging! It keeps your static files clean and consistent with lots of customizability.</p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>I can't remember what lead to the decision, but eventually I decided to make a website. At the time the only knowledge I had of web development was through an html class from junior high. I eventually found <a href="https://zonelets.net" target="_blank">Zonelets</a> which was a lot of fun to mess around with. Although I am grateful of it, for teaching me a lot of javascript, I found it incredibly cumbersome to maintain. Particularly for the page's design.</p>

        <p>I am an impulsive person who likes to change my website's format frequently. Sometimes this requires me to move elements in different places to achieve a certain effect. This means that whenever I wanted to change something I had to either (1) manually edit each html file or (2) append to an exsisting  element. Neither solutions I am very fond of.</p>

        <p>that's basically why tabvoid exist now!</p>
